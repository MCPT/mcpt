  <p>After years of scanning the skies, humans have finally found evidence of extraterrestrial life. From a dark patch of the sky came an alien transmission - an attempt at contact. After months of painstaking analysis, it was determined that the aliens spoke two languages: Vibberish and Cibberish. </p>

  <p>Vibberish is a smooth and simple language that mostly uses words that have more vowels than consonants. On the other hand, the difficult-to-pronounce Cibberish language prefers words with more consonants than vowels.</p>

  <p>As the leading computer scientist at SETI, you have been tasked with detecting the language of a transmission. Given a sentence from the transmission, determine whether it is more likely to be Vibberish or Cibberish. (For our purposes, only <code>a</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>o</code>, and <code>u</code> are considered vowels). </p>

  <h2 class="h2-responsive">Input</h2>

  <p>Each test case contains one sentence of the alien transmission. The sentence will contain only lower-case letters and spaces.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 class="h2-responsive">Output</h2>

  <p>For each test case, output <code>Vibberish</code> if the text is most likely in Vibberish or <code>Cibberish</code> if the text is most likely in Cibberish. If it is equally likely to be Vibberish or Cibberish, then output <code>Gibberish</code>.</p>

  <h2 class="h2-responsive">Explanation of Sample Input</h2>

  <p>In the first case, all four words have more consonants than vowels, so it's likely Cibberish.</p>

  <p>In the second case, one word has mostly vowels and one word has mostly consonants, so it's Gibberish.</p>

  <p>In the last case, there is one word with a vowel majority and no words with a consonant majority, so it's likely Vibberish</p>
